    TALES FROM THE TRAILS
    Sometimes there are no roads to where you
    need to go. No maps for where you need to be.
    On such paths is where you often hear the tales
    of the Jimny. Tales that have been passed down
    from generation to generation since 1970. Tales
    of overcoming insurmountable odds. Tales of
    resilience. Tales of the ones who wouldn’t stop,
    wouldn’t turn back, and their Jimny.
    These are the tales that have inspired each
    generation of the Jimny to venture deeper, climb
    higher and go further than ever before. In its all
    new 5-door avatar, the Jimny takes this driving
    experience to an all-new level.
